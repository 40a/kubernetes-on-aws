=================
Kubernetes on AWS
=================

We decided to use the following branches/channels:

``dev``
  this is the default branch for the project. By default all new features and bugfixing that are not to be considered as ``hotfixes`` will be against this channel.
``alpha``
  this is the branch immediately after ``dev``.
``stable``
  this is the most stable branch.
